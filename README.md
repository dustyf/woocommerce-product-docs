WooCommerce Product Docs
========================

Add documents in WordPress and add as a tab on WooCommerce Products.  

When you add documents, you will have a choice to link them to a product from
WooCommerce.  If a WooCommerce product has linked documents, a new tab will
appear on the WooCommerce Product page with a list of documents.  You can 
also display all documentation with a form to filter results by using the 
shortcode [product_docs].

* Currently requires WooCommerce, Posts 2 Posts, and Advanced Custom Fields *
